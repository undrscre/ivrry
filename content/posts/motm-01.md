# welcome to music of the month!
>this is my first time writing!! plz don’t kill!!! writing about music is hard!!! if you have any suggestions please just let me know in webchat/comments thank you!

this article will feature music that i have listened to recently (or is currently listening) and write my bite-sized thoughts about them :) or maybe refeature songs that i think is really good and worth a relisten – thanks 4 reading ^_^

i’m not sure if i’m gonna do this monthly consistently but let’s see!! hopefully i have enough time for all of this loll i’m also no anthony fantano, i usually don’t do much research behind the album other than my personal opinion regarding the sound but if it’s interesting enough i might cover stuff like meanings behind the songs or something

starting off strong with a self-titled album by saoirse dream! i’m in love with her old discography and generally a fan of her music but i recently realized i have been *sleeping* on this album because holy fuck it’s so good – here’s some of my thoughts on the tracks

i love how the second track just jumpscares you with [this audio clip](https://youtu.be/pHkSRStrFBU) and then immediately hit you with the drop.. it’s giving car crash and siren.. the drums on the beginning of the third track reminds me alot of [shoot to kill](https://soundcloud.com/underscores/stk) by underscores, the way it mixes the *’back it up’* samples into the drums really makes it groove

fourth track is just my favorite that’s all i have to say LOL there’s alot more that i wanted to say but i’m running out of time BYEE i will do the album justice next time trust.. next entry maybe……

hooooly fuck i could not go without mentioning jane remover in this article because I 💖Looovee💖💖💖 Jane Remover you should go take a listen 

this track is the second track on her upcoming album “Revengeseekerz” but also single-handedly one of Jane’s best singles — talking about and bringing back her old music into her new style after she diverted into more indie-rockish shoegaze music with her 2023 album, [census designated](https://soundcloud.com/janeremover/sets/census-designated-1)

with this topic in mind, she went and referenced alot of her old discography, even as far as doing the pose on the album cover of ‘teen week’ — also known as the album that she [‘disliked’](https://pitchfork.com/news/jane-remover-shares-two-new-songs-listen/) — in the music video.

![a comparison of Jane Remover doing the pose in both the music video and the album cover](/assets/blog-media/motm-01/meow.png)

i remember when it first dropped i went *crazy* and couldn’t stop screaming over all my friends and we’re all like
> “HOOOLY FUCKING SHIT IT’S SO GOOD”
> 
> “WE’VE BEEN BLESSED”
> 
> “I’M CRYING”

especially after her side-project [venturing](https://soundcloud.com/02_26_2001/sets/venturing_album_1) also dropping a new album it’s safe to say she knows how to drop bangers back-to-back.  Lets all say “thank you Jane Remover” in unison. if u can’t tell already i’m a \#BigFan

whilst Jane is trying to move away from the shoegaze genre back to her original hyperpop roots, kmoe is doing the exact opposite and surprising us with a new single!

honestly i don’t have much to say for this one except it’s super good and i love the guitars,, reminds me alot about census designated and i love the vibe it’s giving

![go kmoe go!](https://media1.tenor.com/m/Pxb-PU_R01kAAAAd/kmoe-tilted-towers.gif)

okay that’s all lol thank you for reading ^\_^ i didn’t feel like writing more
