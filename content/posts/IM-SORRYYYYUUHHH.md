yusukescookedlobster I’m genuinely so so so sorry. After my last hateful post, I realized that hate is not the answer and an![meow](.media/hatepilled/file-20250313185433725.png)ger is only temporary………… my displeasure with your behavior has caused me to go on a full public outrage and it’s only after i published the post i realized i was in the wrong………

i understand now that tearing someone down, no matter how justified i felt in the moment, only leads to more pain. i should have taken a step back, thought before i spoke, and handled things in a way that reflected who i want to be—not who i was in that moment……….

i don’t expect you to forgive me, and honestly, i wouldn’t blame you if you didn’t. my words were reckless, my deeds were reckless, and my emotions got the better of me. i allowed myself to be blinded by frustration and in doing so, hurt you and contributed to a cycle of negativity that now pains me in every way…………….

if you’re willing, i’d like to make things right. if not, i completely understand. either way, do u wanna play roblox
